# Open source software for dynamics of offshore pipelay

At present, the software includes the following models:
* OTEC pipe 
* PDE pipe 
* Pipelay profile optimization
* Robotic pipe
* Quacking dolphin (LLM Agent to perform static pipelay analysis)

Please check my [Blog](https://gigatskhondia.medium.com/) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giorgi-Tskhondia) for the specifics of the models and algorithms I use.
