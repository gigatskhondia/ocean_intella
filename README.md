# Open source software for dynamics of offshore pipelay

At present, the software includes the following models:
* PDE pipe (needs additional validation)
* Pipelay profile optimization
* Robotic pipe (needs additional validation)

Please check my [blog](https://gigatskhondia.medium.com/) and [manuals](https://github.com/gigatskhondia/ocean_intella/blob/main/docs/pdfs/marine_v3.pdf) for the specifics of the models and algorithms I use.

To keep up to date with the project please check [Gigala](https://gigala.io/) page or check [UVP](https://github.com/gigatskhondia/ocean_intella/blob/main/docs/pdfs/Gigala_5.8.pdf).
