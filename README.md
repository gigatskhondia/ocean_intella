## Ocean Intella (Open source software for dynamics of offshore pipelay)

Ocean Intella is a software for modelling offshore pipelaying statics and dynamics. It is mainly oriented for research purposes, but also can be used for estimating feasibility of real projects.  

At present, the software includes the following models:
* OTEC pipe (renewables)
* PDE pipe 
* Pipelay profile optimization
* Robotic pipe
* Quacking Dolphin (LLM Agent to perform static pipelay analysis)

Philosophy of the software:
* free (accessibility)
* open source (full customization)
* practical performance on your PC (low carbon footprint)
* developed in Python (widespread)
* use AI (modern)

Please check my [Blog](https://gigatskhondia.medium.com/) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372588329_Offshore_engineering) for the specifics of the models and algorithms I use.
