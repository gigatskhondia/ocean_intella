# Ocean Intella

Open source software for dynamics of offshore structures and pipelay. 

## Caution: CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT - NOT PROJECT READY SOLUTION. ##

At present, the software includes the following models:
* PDE pipe (not validated)
* Pipelay profile optimization
* Robotic pipe (not validated)

Please check my [blog](https://gigatskhondia.medium.com/) and [manuals](https://github.com/gigatskhondia/ocean_intella/blob/main/docs/pdfs/marine.pdf) for the specifics of the models and algorithms I use.

To keep up to date with the project please check [Gigala](https://gigala.io/) page.
